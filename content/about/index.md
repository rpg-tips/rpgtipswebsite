Hello and welcome to RPG Tips! I'm JM, the host of a [a Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp_qWaHM9O5dz7gMiXpqKnQ) that I started at the beginning
of 2019 with the initial purpose of giving a structured, organized explanation
of the Mythic Game Master Emulator, a solo roleplaying system, and playing solo in general. If you want
to dive deep down into it, [here's a link to the videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVm5PecA4ZKsi4LxnxVogkcm18Lkybd1b). Now, the channel has evolved a bit into broader topics, always related to RPGs and most of the time related to Solo RPGs.

The purpose of this website is to aggregate the resource lists, mechanics and
actual plays that I will create and write for the channel.

If you want to get in touch with me, you can do it on:
