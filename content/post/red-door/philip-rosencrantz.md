> To start, UNE says that Philip is a "romantic clairvoyant". 

Philip has always wanted more from life, convinced of idealistic principles since he was a child. The fact that he was able to see...

> Ghosts? FC: No. Demons, then.

demons and malevolent spirits when he was a kid served in fostering that feeling. Life was **definitely** more than people said. There were other worlds to see and explore. But that was a long time ago. His gift drifted off on its own, or was it removed? Did it ever exist? That part of his memories is a bit murky. Nowadays, his life is good.

> To generate his current job, I generate another NPC using UNE. He's a corrupt worker, motivated by advocating envy, oppressing affluence and associating the poor. He's... a union representative.

He's a union lawyer, representing the poor workers when their rights have been abused. He's happy, he's able to make a difference in the world, even if it's very little and even if he doesn´t always succeed. Of course, his college friends earn much more money than he does. At least he's not a drone. He hasn´t sold his soul to the establishment. He's very clear in making this point when he talks to his mother: he's not a drone. And if he took that payment once from that company, well, that was because he was going to get evicted and, hey, the workers were not going to be without a job, they were just losing some overtime money. It was nothing. He's making a difference. But he also has to survive.

## Aspects

> To generate his trouble and relations, I ask the oracles.
> Is his trouble something social or personal? 50% chance: Social.
> For his relation... does he have a SO? 50% chance: no. He lives alone, with his golden retriever, Jupiter.

- **High Concept**: Idealistic middle aged union lawyer.
- **Trouble**: they think I'm in companies pockets. Well, I'm not.
- **Hope**: life used to be more than this.
- **Dark Secret**: I was a clairvoyant. No, I'm not making it up!
- **Relation**: I'd rather stay at home with Jupiter, honestly.

## Approaches

> I generate these using the Deck of Fate. They will also give me more information on how Philip does things. Because I don't want him necessarily to be super powerful, I'm going to lower his stats: one +2, two +1, three +0.

- **Careful**: 0.
- **Clever**: +2.
- **Flashy**: +1.
- **Forceful**: 0.
- **Quick**: 0.
- **Sneaky**: +1.

> Interesting: he's clever and can be underhanded or manipulative, specially in the courtroom. But he's not one for physical activity or very attentive to details.

## Stunts

- I've got a silvertongue: once per scene, cross one stress point to convince anyone of whatever you want, as long as it's reasonable.

## Stress

> I'm going to use five individual boxes, ala Blades in the Dark. I will also use stress as fate points: this will also reduce the things I have to track as a GM.
