> Last time I played, almost a year ago, I established that Philip had four possible avenues: track the policeman, track the note, interrogate Chester (the neighbor he saw inside the room) or try to enter the room itself. I'm honestly not too sure about which one to follow. 

> I've recently started using 2d6 to quickly generate something close to a bell curve for phenomenons like the weather, npc dispositions or the quality of something. This was inspired by the Motif Story Engine, though that product uses just 1d6. 

# Wednesday, 6th of November, 2019

## Early Morning

> How did Philip sleep? 2d6 = 7. Standard night. How's the weather like? 2d6 = 5. Light rain, gray sky. Is there anything strange in his flat? Yes (carelessly messy). I'll mix it up with a random clue.

He wakes up, groggy. When he turns to turn on his lamp, he touches a piece of paper that wasn't there last night. As he moves there are sounds of plastic and paper falling on the floor from the bed. What's all this? He didn't bring them to bed last night. He turns on the light and looks at the paper. It's a maze, apparently.

> Does it have anything inside, or remarkable? Yes, cheerfully dark, beguile, win, vandalize, broadcast.

In tiny drawings across the labyrinth, there are pieces of a human body, bloodied, including a head. It's smiling. Somehow, he recognizes it as his head. 

> Does he recognize it as his drawing? No.

He definitely didn't draw that. He's sure of it. But if he didn't... someone entered his home during the night to leave that there. Is it a threat? How's Jupiter? Why didn't he bark? He calls his name outloud.

> Does he come? Exceptional Yes.

As soon as he finishes saying the name, a yellow shadow jumps on him and starts licking his face. He doesn't look or act any different. Should he call the police? Well, the inspector yesterday wanted to come in. Calling them would give them an opportunity to do so. He has a camera pointing at the doorway. Did anybody come during the night? He leaves bed to check the recording.

> Did anybody come during the night? Yes. Someone previously known? Yes. Well, it's either the inspector, Chester, or someone from his job. So 1d3: 2. Chester, his neighbor. How does he look? Miserably dark. Is he carrying anything? Random Event (PC Negative, Truce Liberty) and Yes (corrupt, weep, raid, badmouth).

At 3:11 AM a hunched figure lurks across the hallway in the dark. It's moving in an uncomfortable way, as if he was hurt and walking amplified the pain. In his hands, a ball of crumpled papers and a small black bag. He's walking to his flat.

> Does the camera cover his door? No. Damn.

The field of view of the camera doesn't cover his door, so he doesn't see how he entered his flat. Confused and... well, slightly terrified, he checks the door to the hallway.

> Has it been tampered with? No. Are there any signs of entrance? No. Damn again.

There must be someplace else where he was able to enter from. Did he go back through the same hallway? He checks the file again.

> So, did he? No. DAMN. IF HE'S STILL IN THE FLAT I'M GONNA STOP PLAYING.

Okay, now he's a bit more terrified. He grabs the first hard thing he finds (a wooden cowboy figure his mother gifted him) and moves across the house, quickly, checking every possible corner. But has he got time for this? He's got to go to work too!

> He'll do it Quickly, to try to avoid being late to work, but he's got a 0 there... And he rolls a -1. Nothing.

He's too nervous and stressed, so he doesn't really do a very good job. He checks in a wardrobe and under his bed, but then he just stops and gets dressed to go to work.

> I honestly still don't know if there's a guy there or not and it's freaking me out.
